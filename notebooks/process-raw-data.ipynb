    "Slicing the raw image into individual embryos offers significant memory reduction (average 80% for the images processed so far) and allows for easier processing downstream, since individual movies easily fit the RAM of a regular PC.\n",

    "The first step is to calculate the boundaries of each embryo.\n",
    "The first 10 frames of the movie are used to calculate these boundaries.\n",
    "Using a low threshold (triangle method) we binarize the image and label each one of the embryos.\n",

    "Once we have the boundaries, we open the entire raw data as a memmap, and extract each embryo, splitting channels 1 (active) and 2 (structural).\n",

    "Embryos will be numbered in column-major order: top left corner receives 1, then second embryo is the one immediately below, etc."
