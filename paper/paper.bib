  abstractNote={Mammalian cortical networks are active before synaptogenesis begins in earnest, before neuronal migration is complete, and well before an animal opens its eyes and begins to actively explore its surroundings. This early activity undergoes several transformations during development. The most important of these is a transition from episodic synchronous network events, which are necessary for patterning the neocortex into functionally related modules, to desynchronized activity that is computationally more powerful and efficient. Network desynchronization is perhaps the most dramatic and abrupt developmental event in an otherwise slow and gradual process of brain maturation. In this Review, we summarize what is known about the phenomenology of developmental synchronous activity in the rodent neocortex and speculate on the mechanisms that drive its eventual desynchronization. We argue that desynchronization of network activity is a fundamental step through which the cortex transitions from passive, bottom-up detection of sensory stimuli to active sensory processing with top-down modulation.},

  title={Activity regulates brain development in the fly}, 
  volume={65}, 
  ISSN={0959-437X}, 
  abstractNote={It has long been appreciated that activity sculpts the formation of neuronal circuits in the mammalian brain. By contrast, in Drosophila it was generally thought that genetically hardwired mechanisms of development, mediated by cell recognition molecules, are sufficient to specify the connectome-the complex and stereotyped pattern of connections between neurons. Here, we consider recent findings that activity during development also contributes to circuit assembly in the fly. These observations suggest that activity is a fundamental aspect of brain development in general. They also highlight the opportunities to learn about the role of this phenomenon through the extensive Drosophila toolkit for examining circuit development, structure, and function.},

  abstractNote={Systematic analysis of rich behavioral recordings is being used to uncover how circuits encode complex behaviors. Here, we apply this approach to embryos. What are the first embryonic behaviors and how do they evolve as early neurodevelopment ensues? To address these questions, we present a systematic description of behavioral maturation for Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. Posture libraries were built using a genetically encoded motion capture suit imaged with light-sheet microscopy and annotated using custom tracking software. Analysis of cell trajectories, postures, and behavioral motifs revealed a stereotyped developmental progression. Early movement is dominated by flipping between dorsal and ventral coiling, which gradually slows into a period of reduced motility. Late-stage embryos exhibit sinusoidal waves of dorsoventral bends, prolonged bouts of directed motion, and a rhythmic pattern of pausing, which we designate slow wave twitch (SWT). Synaptic transmission is required for late-stage motion but not for early flipping nor the intervening inactive phase. A high-throughput behavioral assay and calcium imaging revealed that SWT is elicited by the rhythmic activity of a quiescence-promoting neuron (RIS). Similar periodic quiescent states are seen prenatally in diverse animals and may play an important role in promoting normal developmental outcomes.},

  abstractNote={As part of an ongoing effort at Arcadia to enable high-throughput image-based comparisons, we need adaptable ways to capture and record the behavior of motile single-celled organisms across a diverse range of species. In a recent pub, we designed microchambers to observe motile cells, including algae and ciliates [1]. These 3D-printed microchambers used Teflon-coated wells paired with a microscope slide and a polymer coverslip to constrain cells within the field of view (FOV). While our original designs were useful in some contexts, we wanted to generalize our design to allow 1) more flexibility in chamber size and shape to accommodate different-sized organisms and better organism tracking, 2) the ability to capture single cells or organisms within chambers, 3) construction of the microchambers with fewer parts (easier to make chambers robustly!), and 4) to avoid the need for a 3D printer so that researchers can make chambers without costly machinery. We turned to inexpensive (~$200–300) custom-fabricated PDMS stamps to mold agar along with standard microscope slides and coverslips. We demonstrate several different use cases for agar microchambers, including 1) organismal tracking, 2) high-speed sub-cellular imaging, and 3) long-term imaging of unicellular organisms and nematode development. Finally, we provide a testable framework for choosing an ideal microchamber design based on organismal size. We hope that this resource will be useful for anyone interested in increasing throughput for phenotyping microorganisms with microscopy.},

  title={Mechanisms underlying spontaneous patterned activity in developing neural circuits}, 
  volume={11}, 
  ISSN={1471-003X}, 
  abstractNote={Patterned, spontaneous activity occurs in many developing neural circuits, including the retina, the cochlea, the spinal cord, the cerebellum and the hippocampus, where it provides signals that are important for the development of neurons and their connections. Despite there being differences in adult architecture and output across these various circuits, the patterns of spontaneous network activity and the mechanisms that generate it are remarkably similar. The mechanisms can include a depolarizing action of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), transient synaptic connections, extrasynaptic transmission, gap junction coupling and the presence of pacemaker-like neurons. Interestingly, spontaneous activity is robust; if one element of a circuit is disrupted another will generate similar activity. This research suggests that developing neural circuits exhibit transient and tunable features that maintain a source of correlated activity during crucial stages of development.},

  title={Mechanosensory input during circuit formation shapes Drosophila motor behavior through patterned spontaneous network activity}, 
  volume={31}, 
  ISSN={0960-9822}, 
  abstractNote={Neural activity sculpts circuit wiring in many animals. In vertebrates, patterned spontaneous network activity (PaSNA) generates sensory maps and establishes local circuits.1-3 However, it remains unclear how PaSNA might shape neuronal circuits and behavior in invertebrates. Previous work in the developing Drosophila embryo discovered intrinsic muscle activity that did not require synaptic transmission, and hence was myogenic, preceding PaSNA.4-6 These studies, however, monitored muscle movement, not neural activity, and were therefore unable to observe how myogenic activity might relate to subsequent neural network engagement. Here we use calcium imaging to directly record neural activity and characterize the emergence of PaSNA. We demonstrate that the spatiotemporal properties of PaSNA are highly stereotyped across embryos, arguing for genetic programming. Neural activity begins well before it becomes patterned, emerging during the myogenic stage. Remarkably, inhibition of mechanosensory input, as well as inhibition of muscle contractions, results in premature and excessive PaSNA, demonstrating that muscle movement serves as a brake on this process. Finally, transient mechanosensory inhibition during PaSNA, followed by quantitative modeling of larval behavior, shows that mechanosensory modulation during development is required for proper larval foraging. This work provides a foundation for using the Drosophila embryo to study the role of PaSNA in circuit formation, provides mechanistic insight into how PaSNA is entrained by motor activity, and demonstrates that spontaneous network activity is essential for locomotor behavior. These studies argue that sensory feedback during the earliest stages of circuit formation can sculpt locomotor behaviors through innate motor learning.},

  abstractNote={High-throughput live-imaging of embryos is an essential technique in developmental biology, but it is difficult and costly to mount and image embryos in consistent conditions. Here, we present OMMAwell, a simple, reusable device to easily mount dozens of embryos in arrays of agarose microwells with customizable dimensions and spacing. OMMAwell can be configured to mount specimens for upright or inverted microscopes, and includes a reservoir to hold live-imaging medium to maintain constant moisture and osmolarity of specimens during time-lapse imaging. All device components can be fabricated by cutting pieces from a sheet of acrylic using a laser cutter or by making them with a 3D printer. We demonstrate how to design a custom mold and use it to live-image dozens of embryos at a time. We include descriptions, schematics, and design files for 13 additional molds for nine animal species, including most major traditional laboratory models and a number of emerging model systems. Finally, we provide instructions for researchers to customize OMMAwell inserts for embryos or tissues not described herein.},

  ISSN={0001-0782}, 
  abstractNote={A new paradigm, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), for fitting a model to experimental data is introduced. RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing},

It does this while requiring minimal user intervention, with good scalability on computers ranging from laptops to high-performance computing clusters. CaImAn is suitable for two-photon and one-photon imaging, and also enables real-time analysis on streaming data. To benchmark the performance of CaImAn we collected and combined a corpus of manual annotations from multiple labelers on nine mouse two-photon datasets.

Thus, creating improved technologies for large-scale recordings of neural activity in the live brain is a crucial goal in neuroscience. Over the past two decades, the combination of optical microscopy and genetically encoded fluorescent indicators has become a widespread means of recording neural activity in nonmammalian and mammalian nervous systems, transforming brain research in the process. In this review, we describe and assess different classes of fluorescent protein indicators of neural activity. We first discuss general considerations in optical imaging and then present salient characteristics of representative indicators. Our focus is on how indicator characteristics relate to their use in living animals and on likely areas of future progress.},

  DOI={10.7554/elife.95209.2}, 
  abstractNote={Summary Movement is a key feature of animal systems, yet its embryonic origins are not fully understood. Here we investigate the genetic basis underlying the embryonic onset of movement in Drosophila focusing on the role played by small non-coding RNAs (microRNAs, miRNAs). To this end, we first develop a quantitative behavioural pipeline capable of tracking embryonic movement in large populations of fly embryos, and using this system, discover that the Drosophila miRNA miR-2b-1 plays a role in the emergence of movement. Through the combination of spectral analysis of embryonic motor patterns, cell sorting and RNA in situs, genetic reconstitution tests, and neural optical imaging we define that miR-2b-1 influences the emergence of embryonic movement by exerting actions in the developing nervous system. Furthermore, through the combination of bioinformatics coupled to genetic manipulation of miRNA expression and phenocopy tests we identify a previously uncharacterised (but evolutionarily conserved) chloride channel encoding gene – which we term Movement Modulator (Motor) – as a genetic target that mechanistically links miR-2b-1 to the onset of movement. Cell-specific genetic reconstitution of miR-2b-1 expression in a null miRNA mutant background, followed by behavioural assays and target gene analyses, suggest that miR-2b-1 affects the emergence of movement through effects in sensory elements of the embryonic circuitry, rather than in the motor domain. Our work thus reports the first miRNA system capable of regulating embryonic movement, suggesting that other miRNAs are likely to play a role in this key developmental process in Drosophila as well as in other species.},

  volume={19}, 
  ISSN={1087-0156}, 
  abstractNote={Recently, several groups have developed green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based Ca(2+) probes. When applied in cells, however, these probes are difficult to use because of a low signal-to-noise ratio. Here we report the development of a high-affinity Ca(2+) probe composed of a single GFP (named G-CaMP). G-CaMP showed an apparent K(d) for Ca(2+) of 235 nM. Association kinetics of Ca(2+) binding were faster at higher Ca(2+) concentrations, with time constants decreasing from 230 ms at 0.2 microM Ca(2+) to 2.5 ms at 1 microM Ca(2+). Dissociation kinetics (tau approximately 200 ms) are independent of Ca(2+) concentrations. In HEK-293 cells and mouse myotubes expressing G-CaMP, large fluorescent changes were observed in response to application of drugs or electrical stimulations. G-CaMP will be a useful tool for visualizing intracellular Ca2+ in living cells. Mutational analysis, together with previous structural information, suggests the residues that may alter the fluorescence of GFP.},

While the sensors and microscopes have matured over several generations of development, computational methods to process the resulting movies remain inefficient and can give results that are hard to interpret.

Suite2p runs on standard workstations, operates faster than real time, and recovers ~2 times more cells than the previous state-of-the-art method. Its low computational load allows routine detection of ~10,000 cells simultaneously with standard two-photon resonant-scanning microscopes.
